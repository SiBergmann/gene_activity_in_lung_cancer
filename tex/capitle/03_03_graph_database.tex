\subsection{Graph Database} \label{subsec:graph_database}
% This subsection should focus on describing the Cypher queries used to create and populate your graph database.
% It includes information about creating indexes, constraints, relationships between nodes, and loading data into the database.

% Intro
* For our next Objective~\ref we need to create a graph db on which we can perform the Page rank as a graph algorithm.
In the last subsection we created the data models for the graph database.
* Sll 4 models are huge datasets, so we need to optimize the generation of the database

% protein nodes query:
* 101.731 nodes of the type protein with the property id
* create index on protein property id for faster query
* load data as list
* create nodes in batches

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Cypher, label={lst:protein_nodes}]
    CREATE (p:protein {id: 'Protein ID'})
\end{lstlisting}

% protein protein edges query:
% todo check numbers!!current number is only proteins directly on genes
* 11.247.242 Edges between protein nodes with the property id
* load data as list of protein tuples
* for each tuple search for both protein nodes by ID and create an edges in batches
% MATCH only search not create

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Cypher, label={lst:protein_edges}]
    MATCH (s:protein{id:'left Protein ID'})
    MATCH (s:protein{id:'right Protein ID'})
    CREATE (s)-[:INTERACTS]->(t)
\end{lstlisting}

-> PPI Network


% gene nodes query:
* 17.626 nodes of the type gene with the property id,
* create index on gene property id for faster query
* load data as list
* create nodes in batches

%TODO check if this is the final version of the query
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Cypher, label={lst:gene_nodes}]
    CREATE (p:gene {
    id: id,
    gene_name: gene_name,
    norm_healthy_tpm: norm_healthy_tpm,
    norm_cancerous_tpm: norm_cancerous_tpm,
    delta_tpm: delta_tpm,
    delta_type: delta_type,
    delta_tpm_relevant: delta_tpm_relevant})
\end{lstlisting}


% gene protein edges query:
* 101.731 Edges between gene and protein nodes with the property id
* load data as list of gene-protein tuples
* for each tuple search for the gene node and the protein node by ID and create an edge in batches

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Cypher, label={lst:gene_protein_edges}]
    MATCH (s:protein{id:'Protein ID'})
    MATCH (s:gene{id:'Gene ID'})
    CREATE (s)-[:CONNECTION]-(t)
\end{lstlisting}

% TODO Bezeichnung der IDs zb nochmal anpassen, da nicht sch√∂n
