\subsection{Graph Database} \label{subsec:graph_database}
% This subsection should focus on describing the Cypher queries used to create and populate your graph database.
% It includes information about creating indexes, constraints, relationships between nodes, and loading data into the database.

% Description of the graph database schema (nodes, relationships, properties)
% Cypher queries used to create indexes and constraints in the database
% Methods used to load data into the database
% Relationships between nodes (e.g. protein-gene edges)
% Any optimizations or indexing strategies used to improve query performance
% Methods used to visualize or query the graph database (e.g. using Neo4J's built-in tools)
