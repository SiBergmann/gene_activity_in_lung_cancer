% Problem
Lung cancer is a major public health problem worldwide, caused by various factors,
including smoking, air pollution, and also genetic factors.
% TODO J - Quelle
It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide\cite{ferlay2024global}.
Despite advances in medical care, the survival rate for patients remains relatively low,
with only $30.2\%$ of women and $22.1\%$ of men (2016)
surviving beyond five years after diagnosis~\cite{seer2024explorer}, often due to late-stage detection.
Therfore, early detection is crucial to initiate timely treatment and ultimately reduce the mortality rate.

% Solution
We focus on analyzing gene expression data to identify potential biomarkers for lung cancer.
We use graph databases for this purpose,
as they offer ways to represent complex relationships between large sets of genes and proteins
and analyze them efficiently using graph based algorithms.
These data provide valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of lung cancer
and help to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.
