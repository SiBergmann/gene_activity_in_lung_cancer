% Problem
Lung cancer poses a significant global health threat, with multiple factors contributing to its development,
including smoking, air pollution, and genetic factors~\cite{ferlay2024global}.
It is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide~\cite{ferlay2024global}.
Despite advances in medical care, the prognosis for patients remains relatively low,
with only $30.2\%$ of women and $22.1\%$ of men (2016) surviving beyond five years after diagnosis~\cite{seer2024explorer},
often due to late-stage detection.
Therefore, early detection is crucial to initiate timely treatment and reduce mortality rates.

% Solution
To address this challenge, we leverage gene expression data to identify potential biomarkers for lung cancer,
enabling us to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this disease.
Graph databases provide a powerful toolset, as they offer ways to represent complex relationships
between large datasets and analyze them efficiently using graph-based algorithms.
By analyzing these data, we gain valuable insights that can be translated into improved early diagnosis and treatment strategies.
