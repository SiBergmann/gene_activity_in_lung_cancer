\section{Background} \label{sec:background}
In this chapter we will take a closer look at the biological and computational background of our project.
Also, we will discuss related work in the field cancer research with graph databases.

Overall, in the course of this background section,
we have gained a comprehensive overview of the biological background of lung cancer and
the importance of gene expression analysis.
In particular, we have looked at TPM values, which are an important measure of gene activity.

We have established that the use of graph databases is an effective way to analyze complex networks,
and we have explained corresponding algorithms, especially the PageRank algorithm.

Finally, we have reviewed related work in the field of graph databases in cancer research.
