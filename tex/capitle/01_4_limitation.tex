\subsection{Limitations} \label{subsec:limitations}
Our study focuses on lung cancer due to its high incidence rate and the availability of relevant datasets.
However, this focus may not be representative for other types of cancers or diseases.
We will only consider protein-coding genes in our analysis due to technical constraints related to our graph database setup.
Rather than collecting new data, we will utilize existing datasets to expedite the analysis and focus on method development.
But our experimental setup may also be used for other datasets ins future.\\
