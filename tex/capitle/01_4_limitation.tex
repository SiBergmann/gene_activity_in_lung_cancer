% our Choice
Firstly, the scope of our study is focused on lung cancer, which may not be representative of other types of cancers or diseases.

Secondly, we only considered protein-coding genes in our analysis.
This decision was made due to our experimental setup.

% limitied due to dataset
We relied on gene expression data from the GTEx and Cell Model Passport datasets.
While these resources are widely used and well-established, they do have limitations in terms of their scope and coverage.
The GTEx dataset consists of only adult postmortem donor samples, with 2/3 of them between 50 and 69 years old and 2/3 being male.
The Cell Model Passport dataset contains data from donors who are predominantly male (60\%)
and have an age range that is biased towards older adults (50-69 years old).
Especially the focus on the older age range may affect the generalizability of our findings to other populations.\\
