    Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide,
    making the identification of relevant genes for diagnosis and treatment an urgent task.
    While traditional methods have limitations in capturing complex relationships between genes and proteins,
    our graph-based approach allows us to overcome these challenges.


    In this thesis, we present a novel graph-based analysis of gene activity in lung cancer and healthy tissues based on protein-interaction networks.
    Our method integrates over 17,000 genes, 100,000 proteins, and 13,000,000 interactions into a comprehensive graph database,
    enabling the identification of relevant genes with high connectivity in the network.


    We identified a set of highly connected genes in lung cancer tissue that have significant changes in gene activity
    from those found in healthy tissue, suggesting potential links to carcinogenesis.
