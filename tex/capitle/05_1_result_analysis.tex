%general Notes
As the final milestone of our study goal we need to fulfill the last objective\cref{obj:validation} by analyzing and
validating the results of the PageRank algorithm.



% 1 - NDRG2
The gene \textbf{NDRG2} (N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2) plays a critical role as a tumor suppressor,
regulating cell growth and preventing the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body.
Its importance is particularly pronounced in tissues that are more likely for tumorigenesis,
highlighting its potential as a key regulator of cellular behavior~\cite{Lee2022NDRG2}

Recent studies have shed light on NDRG2's role in human lung cancer,
revealing that low expression levels of this gene are associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis in patients.
Specifically, research has demonstrated that NDRG2 acts as a crucial suppressor of tumor cell metastasis and
functions as a negative regulator of tumor progression~\cite{Li2013NDRG2}.
Furthermore, another study has shown that downregulation of NDRG2, particularly in small-cell lung cancer,
inhibits tumor progression, underscoring the gene's importance in this context~\cite{Ma2024NDRG2}.

Our analysis highlights NDRG2 as a potential key player in the lung cancer landscape,
with a PageRank score of 25.635 and a significant downregulation in lung cancer cells ($\Delta_{TPM}$ = -0.317).
Notably, it boasts the highest delta TPM value among the top 10 genes,
indicating a substantial decrease in expression levels in lung cancer cells.
\newline

% 2 - DMKN
The gene \textbf{DMKN}, also known as Dermokine, is a gene involved in skin cell function and regulation.
Specifically, it plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the outer layer of the skin
by regulating various cellular processes~\cite{Naso2007Deromokine}.

While DMKN has not been directly implicated in lung cancer, its connections to other cancers offer valuable insights into its potential function.
Notably, research has demonstrated that DMKN-$\alpha$ is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer~\cite{Zhang2022DMKN}
and the $\beta$ isoform is downregulated in skin cancer and serves as a biomarker for early-stage colorectal cancer~\cite{Hasegawa2012Dermokine}.

It has a PageRank score of 19.900 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.203, indicating further investigation into this gene's role is warranted.
\newline

% 3 - CAPN3
The gene \textbf{CAPN3}, also known as Calpain 3, is an integral component of the Calpain system,
a complex network of gene products and proteins that play critical roles in cellular processes.
Primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells, CAPN3 plays a pivotal role in maintaining muscle function and integrity~\cite{Spinozzi2021Calpain}.

Although CAPN3 has been extensively studied in the context of muscle diseases,
its involvement in cancer, particularly lung cancer, remains poorly understood.
However, research has shown that the Calpain system, which includes CAPN3, is implicated in cancer progression and metastasis~\cite{Storr2011Calpain}.
Notably, studies have demonstrated that another member of the Calpain system, Calpain 2, is upregulated in lung cancer~\cite{Xu2019Calpain}.

Our analysis suggests that CAPN3 may be a gene of interest in lung cancer research.
With a PageRank score of 18.136 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.310.
It holds the second-highest decrease in expression levels among the top 10 genes,
underscoring its potential significance in lung cancer research.
\newline

% 4 - SLC6A1
The \textbf{SLC6A1} gene encodes a protein that functions as a GABA carrier,
playing a crucial role in regulating neurotransmitter levels at synapses between neurons~\cite{Chen2020SLC6A1}.

Research has demonstrated that SLC6A1 promotes cancer growth in certain types of tumors,
including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer~\cite{Chen2020SLC6A1}.
This suggests a potential role for SLC6A1 in tumor progression and metastasis.

Our analysis found that SLC6A1 is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a PageRank score of 14.170 and a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.267.
Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential implications for lung cancer research.
\newline

%5 - SLC1A2
The \textbf{SLC1A2} gene encodes a protein that functions as a glutamate transporter,
playing a crucial role in regulating glutamate levels in the brain by removing glutamate from synapses~\cite{NCBI2017SLC1A2}.

Research has identified SLC1A2 as a partner gene in fusion genes associated with certain types of cancer.
Notably, studies have found that CD44-SLC1A2 fusions are present in gastric cancer~\cite{Tao2011CD44} and
primary colorectal cancer~\cite{Shinmura2015CD44}, indicating its potential role in cancer development.
Additionally, an analogous APIP/SLC1A2 fusion has been identified in colon cancer~\cite{Giacomini2013Breakpoint}.
Notably, these gene fusions were not detected in non-small cell lung cancers~\cite{Shinmura2015CD44}.

In contrast to these findings, our analysis reveals that SLC1A2 is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a PageRank score of 13.729 and a $\Delta_{TPM}$value of -0.233.
THis finding raises questions about the gene's role in lung cancer and warrants further investigation.
\newline

%6 - BRCA1
The \textbf{BRCA1} gene, also known as Breast Cancer Gene 1, is a tumor suppressor gene
that produces a protein involved in repairing damaged DNA\@.
This process is essential for maintaining genome stability by facilitating the correct repair of DNA breaks~\cite{NCI2020BRCA1}.

BRCA1 has been associated with various types of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancers\cite{Lee2020BRCA1}.
However, its relationship to lung cancer is more complex.
Initial research suggested a potential link between overexpressed BRCA1 and
poor survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients\cite{Rosell2007BRCA1}.
However, subsequent studies have contradicted this notion,
saying that BRCA1 does not play a role in NSCLC~\cite{Gachechiladze2012BRCA1,Lee2020BRCA1}.

Interestingly, our analysis reveals a different pattern for BRCA1 in lung cancer cells.
With a PageRank score of 13.288 and a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of 0.214,
BRCA1 is upregulated in these cells, making it the only gene in our Top 10 list to exhibit this behavior.
\newline

%7 - FHL1
The \textbf{FHL1} (four and a half LIM domains 1) gene encodes a protein
involved in regulating muscle cell differentiation and maturation,
playing a crucial role in maintaining proper muscle function.
It is primarily expressed in striated muscles but also found in other tissues such as the brain and testis~\cite{Storey2020FHL1}.

FHL1 has been implicated in various types of cancer, including breast, kidney, prostate and gastric cancer.
Research suggests that FHL1 expression is often reduced in these cancers,
which may contribute to their development\cite{Li2008FHL1, Sakashita2008FHL1}.
Specifically, studies have found that FHL1 is downregulated in NSCLC patients~\cite{Niu2012FHL1}.

Our analysis reveals that FHL1 has a PageRank score of 12.849 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.217.
\newline

%8 - MBP
The \textbf{MBP} (Myelin Basic Protein) gene plays a crucial role in producing proteins essential for creating and
maintaining the protective myelin covering around nerve fibers, as well as
facilitating repair of damaged nerve coverings and regulating immune cell responses to infections or inflammation~\cite{Nye1995MBP}.

MBP has been linked to cancer research, particularly in the context of brain tumors.
Studies have suggested that MBP levels are elevated in patients with brain cancer and may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis.
However, increased MBP levels have also been observed in other brain diseases, such as multiple sclerosis~\cite{Zavialova2017MBP}.
Furthermore, research has found a correlation between MBP expression levels and brain metastasis from lung cancer~\cite{Nakagawa1994MBP}.

Interestingly, our analysis reveals that MBP is downregulated in lung cancer cells with a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.296.
This finding appears to contradict previous research suggesting elevated MBP levels in brain tumors,
including those metastasizing from lung cancer.
Further investigation is needed to fully understand the role of MBP in lung cancer biology.
\newline

%9 - ELN
The \textbf{ELN} gene encodes for the protein Elastin,
a key component of connective tissue that provides elasticity and
flexibility to tissues such as skin, lungs, and blood vessels~\cite{Debelle1999ELN}.

According to studies, elastin plays a significant role in cancer development.
Research has shown that elastin gene expression is increased in tumors from colorectal cancer patients~\cite{Li2020ELN}.
In breast cancer, elastosis, a condition characterized by an abnormal increase in elastin fibers,
is a common feature that increases with tumor progression~\cite{Lepucki2022ELN}.
Additionally, studies have found that Elastin in gastric cancer tissues is linked to changes that enable cancer cells
to spread more easily~\cite{Fang2023ELN}.

However, our study reveals a different pattern for ELN in lung cancer cells:
despite its significance in other cancers, ELN expression is actually downregulated, with a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.246.
This unexpected finding suggests that the role of Elastin in lung cancer biology may be more complex.
\newline

%10 - ARPP21
The \textbf{ARPP21} (cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 21) gene is involved in regulating cellular processes,
particularly in brain development and function.
It plays a crucial role in shaping the complexity of neurons during development~\cite{Rehfeld2018ARPP21}.

In addition to its direct impact on brain development, research has uncovered an indirect link between ARPP21 and cancer.
Specifically, the microRNA produced by ARPP21, miR-128, has been implicated in various types of cancer~\cite{Li2013ARPP21}.
Notably, studies have shown that miR-128 is downregulated in prostate cancer~\cite{Khan2010ARPP21}, ovarian cancer~\cite{Woo2012ARPP21},
and breast cancer~\cite{Zhu2011ARPP21}.

While the direct connection between ARPP21 and cancer remains unclear,
its connection to miR-128 suggests an indirect role for ARPP21 in cancer development.
Our analysis provides further insight into this relationship, revealing that ARPP21 is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta_{TPM}$ value of -0.201.
\newline
