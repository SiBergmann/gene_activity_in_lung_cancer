% NDRG2
\textbf{NDRG2} (N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2) is a tumor suppressor gene that helps control cell growth and
prevents cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body.
It is particularly important in regulating cells in tissues that are more likely to develop tumors. \cite{Lee2022NDRG2}

Our analysis reveals that NDRG2 has a PageRank score of 25.635003 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a delta TPM value of -0.317776.
