%general Notes
A first glance at the dataset of all genes reveals the complexity of gene expression in our study.
To establish a foundation for interpreting the results of the top 10 most relevant genes,
we examined the distribution of Pagerank scores and $\Delta\_TPM$ values across the entire dataset

The PageRank scores display an initial peak at approximately 67, which stands out as a significant outlier.
This is followed by a sharp decline to around 40, with subsequent scores showing progressively smaller differences
as they approach the mid-30s range.
Notably, once the scores fall to this level, the gaps between them become considerably narrower.
%TODO This overall distribution suggests a pattern of exponential or logarithmic decay, indicating that the majority of the scores are heavily concentrated towards the higher end.

The data show a symmetric distribution of $\Delta\_TPM$ values, with a pronounced peak around zero, suggesting a central tendency near the mean.
The data ranges approximately from -0.709 to 0.423, indicating moderate variability, and appears to follow a normal-like distribution.

% 1 - NDRG2
\textbf{NDRG2} (N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2) is a tumor suppressor gene that helps control cell growth and
prevents cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body.
It is particularly important in regulating cells in tissues that are more likely to develop tumors~\cite{Lee2022NDRG2}.

Our analysis reveals that NDRG2 has a PageRank score of 25.635 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.317.
It has the highest delta TPM value among the top 10 genes, indicating a significant decrease in expression levels in lung cancer cells.
\newline

% 2 - DMKN
\textbf{DMKN}, also known as Dermokine, is a gene involved in skin cell function and regulation.
It helps regulate cellular processes in the outer layer of the skin, where it plays a role in maintaining skin health~\cite{Naso2007Deromokine}.

Our analysis reveals that DMKN has a PageRank score of 19.900 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.203.

% 3 - CAPN3
The \textbf{CAPN3} (calpain 3) gene is part of the Calpain system, which includes multiple gene products and proteins.
It is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a crucial role in muscle function~\cite{Spinozzi2021Calpain}.

Our analysis reveals that CAPN3 has a PageRank score of 18.136 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.310.
It has the second-highest decrease in expression levels among the top 10 genes.
\newline

% 4 - SLC6A1
\textbf{SLC6A1} is the shorting for the gene solute carrier family 6 member 1,
which encodes a protein that acts as a GABA carrier,
helping to regulate the levels of this neurotransmitter at synapses between neurons~\cite{Chen2020SLC6A1}.

In our analysis the gene has a PageRank score of 14.170 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.267.
\newline

%5 - SLC1A2
The \textbf{SLC1A2}, is another of the family of solute transporter proteins, which is primarily known as glutamat transporter.
It plays a crucial role in regulating glutamate levels in the brain by removing glutamate from synapses.\cite{NCBI2017SLC1A2}

In our analysis the gene has a PageRank score of 13.729 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.233.
\newline

%6 - BRCA1
The \textbf{BRCA1}, Breast Cancer Gene 1, gene is a tumor suppressor gene that produces a protein involved in repairing damaged DNA\@.
It plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability by facilitating the correct repair of DNA breaks~\cite{NCI2020BRCA1}.

Our analysis reveals that BRCA1 has a PageRank score of 13.288 and is upregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of 0.214.
In our Top 10 list it is the only gene that is upregulated in lung cancer cells.
\newline

%7 - FHL1
The \textbf{FHL1} (four and a half LIM domains 1) gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating muscle cell differentiation and maturation.
It is primarily expressed in striated muscles but also found in other tissues such as the brain and testis~\cite{Storey2020FHL1}.

Our analysis reveals that FHL1 has a PageRank score of 12.849 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.217.
\newline

%8 - MBP
The \textbf{MBP} (Myelin Basic Protein) gene helps produce proteins that are essential for creating and maintaining the protective covering around nerve fibers,
called myelin.
It also plays a role in helping the body repair damaged nerve coverings and
regulates how immune cells respond to infections or inflammation~\cite{Nye1995MBP}.

Our analysis reveals that MBP has a PageRank score of 12.848 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.296.
\newline

%9 - ELN
The \textbf{ELN} (Elastin) gene encodes for the protein Elastin, which is a key component of connective tissue that provides elasticity and
flexibility to tissues such as skin, lungs, and blood vessels~\cite{Debelle1999ELN}.

Our analysis reveals that ELN has a PageRank score of 11.119 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.246.
\newline

%10 - ARPP21
The \textbf{ARPP21} (cAMP regulated phosphoprotein 21) gene is involved in regulating cellular processes, particularly in brain development and function.
It plays a crucial role in shaping the complexity of neurons during development~\cite{Rehfeld2018ARPP21}.

Our analysis reveals that ARPP21 has a PageRank score of 11.089 and is downregulated in lung cancer cells,
with a $\Delta\_TPM$ value of -0.201.
