\subsection{Structure}  \label{subsec:structure}

The thesis starts with a closer look at the biological and computational background of the project (chapter~\ref{sec:background}),
which includes a comprehensive overview of lung cancer, gene expression analysis, and graph databases in cancer research.
Next, we describe the experimental setup and methodology employed to collect and analyze data (chapter~\ref{sec:methodology}),
including the creation of a graph database and the application of a graph algorithm.
The result of our investigation is presented in chapter~\ref{sec:results}.
We then delve into the implications and significance of these findings,
providing a comprehensive analysis of their relevance to lung cancer research and provide an outlook
on future research directions (chapter~\ref{sec:discussion}).
Finally, we conclude by summarizing the key takeaways from our study (chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}).
