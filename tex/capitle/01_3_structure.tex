The thesis starts with a closer look at the biological and computational background of the project (section~\ref{sec:background}),
which includes a comprehensive overview of lung cancer, gene expression analysis, and graph databases in cancer research.

Next, we describe the experimental setup and methodology employed to collect and analyze data (section~\ref{sec:methodology}),
including the creation of a graph database and the application of a graph algorithm.

The result of our investigation is presented in chapter~\ref{sec:results}.

We then delve into the implications and significance of these findings,
providing a comprehensive analysis of their relevance to lung cancer research (section~\ref{sec:discussion}).

Finally, we conclude by summarizing the key takeaways from our study and provide an outlook
on future research directions (section~\ref{sec:conclusion}).
