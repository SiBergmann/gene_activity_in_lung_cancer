The chapter \ref{sec:background}provides a detailed overview of the biological and computational background of the project,
including facts about lung cancer, the importance of gene expression analysis and the use of graph databases in cancer research.

In the third chapter \ref{sec:experimental-setup}, we will describe the setup,
including the data sources and the creation of the graph database.

The fourth chapter \ref{sec:results} presents the results of the graph analysis and the identified relevant genes.

The fifth chapter \ref{sec:discussion} discusses the results and compares them with other studies.

The final chapter \ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the findings and provides an outlook on future research.
