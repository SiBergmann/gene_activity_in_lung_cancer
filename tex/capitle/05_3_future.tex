* Pagerank is a good way to find important genes - well established / known / typical research \\
* Clear finding of new genes that may be biomarkers\\
* Analyse the top 10 genes seems to find good results\\

% Future Work
* These should be further investigated in future studies\\
*  collective behavior of multiple genes rather than focusing solely on individual genes
