\subsection{Goals} \label{subsec:goals}

The main goal of this thesis is to identify potential biomarkers for lung cancer by analyzing gene expression data.
These Biomarkers could be used for early detection or personalized treatment.
This will be done by uncovering genes with altered cancer activity that are closely connected to other genes.

To achieve this goal, we have three strategic objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Objective - Find significant changes in gene activity:}\\
    We must first decide on an appropriate measurement for cancer-related changes in gene activity.
    Next, we will compare the expression levels of healthy and cancerous tissues to identify genes with substantial differences.
    These genes will serve as our focus for further analysis.

    \item \textbf{Objective - Application of a graph algorithm:}\\
    We will construct a graph database containing genetic information with connections between genes and proteins.
    By applying a graph algorithm, we aim to identify the most central genes in the network,
    which may have the highest impact on other genes.
    \label{obj:graph_algorithm}

    \item \textbf{Objective - Validation of results through study comparison:}\\
    We will check whether our identified genes are already known to be associated with lung cancer or cancer in general.

\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, these objectives provide a clear roadmap for achieving our main goal.
By determining significant changes in gene activity, applying graph algorithms,
and validating results through comparisons with existing research,
we aim to contribute meaningfully to lung cancer research.
