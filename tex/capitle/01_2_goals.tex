\subsection{Goals} \label{subsec:goals}
The main goal of this thesis is to identify potential biomarkers for lung cancer by examining gene activity data.
These biomarkers could be used for early detection or personalized treatment.
This will be done by uncovering genes with altered cancer activity that are closely connected to other genes.

To achieve this goal, we have three strategic objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Objective - Find significant changes in gene activity:}\\
    We must first decide on an appropriate measurement for cancer-related changes in gene activity.
    Next, we will compare this gene activity measure for healthy and cancerous tissues to identify genes with substantial differences.
    These genes will serve as our focus for further analysis.

    \item \textbf{Objective - Application of a graph algorithm:}\\
    We will construct a graph database containing genetic information with connections between genes and proteins.
    By applying a graph algorithm, we aim to identify the most central genes in the network,
    which may have the highest impact on other genes.
    \label{obj:graph_algorithm}

    \item \textbf{Objective - Validation of results through study comparison:}\\
    We will assess the relevance and novelty of our findings by comparing them with existing research on lung cancer.
    By validating our results against established knowledge, we want to ensure that our identified genes are potential biomarkers.
    \label{obj:validation}
\end{enumerate}

These objectives provide a roadmap for achieving our main goal.
By determining significant changes in gene activity, applying graph algorithms,
and validating results through comparisons with existing research,
we aim to contribute meaningfully to lung cancer research.
