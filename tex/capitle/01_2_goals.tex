% description of the problem / idea

% goals of the thesis:
    % Main: identify genes that are relevant for research in lung cancer
    % to reach this I will:
        % 1. create a graph database with gene and protein information → to take advantage of the relationships between genes and proteins
        % 2. use a graph algorithm → to identify relevant genes for distinguishing between healthy and lung cancer
        % 3. compare identified genes with other papers → to validate the results
