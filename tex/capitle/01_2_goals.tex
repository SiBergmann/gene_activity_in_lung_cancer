The main goal of this thesis is to identify genes that have a high likelihood
of being associated with lung cancer development or progression.


To achieve this, we have three strategic objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Objective - Find significant changes in gene activity:}
    % Find a appropriate measurement for cancer related changes in gene activty.
    We will calculate the change in this measurement between healthy and cancerous tissues
    and define if this difference is significant
    to be able to later focus on these genes.
    \label{obj:delta_tpm}

    \item \textbf{Objective - Application of a graph algorithm:}
    % We will create a graph database that contains genetic information with interactions between genes and proteins.
    We will use a graph algorithm to identify genes that are most central in the network
    to find candidates that are most likely to be biomarkers for lung cancer.
    \label{obj:graph_algorithm}

    \item \textbf{Objective - Validation of results through study comparison:}
    We will compare the identified genes,
    which exhibit significant changes in activity (\ref{obj:delta_tpm})
    and are highly influential in the network (\ref{obj:graph_algorithm}) with other studies
    to validate our results and ensure that their reproducible.
    \label{obj:validation}
\end{enumerate}


% TODO Expected Outcomes

{\color{lightgray}
Our expected outcomes are:
A list of genes with high likelihood as potential biomarkers for lung cancer can be identified.
This gene list is confirmed by a comprehensive analysis of the literature and comparisons with existing research papers.
