\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with significant implications for public health and individual well-being.
This thesis aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat this disease through
identifying potential biomarkers using graph databases and algorithms.

In conclusion, this thesis aims to find novel biomarkers on lung cancer
by investigating the potential of graph databases and algorithms in the context of lung cancer research.
We will focus on three objectives to achieve this goal:
analyse gene expression data, build a graph database and apply a graph algorithm, and validate the results.
The following chapters will provide a detailed explanation of the methods used and the results obtained.
