\subsection{Study Evaluation and Limitations} \label{subsec:evaluation}

{\color{lightgray}
* Other datasets could be used like TCGA which is common in cancer research \\
* CMP Dataset matched with ENS ID Names might be wrong - would be better to find a good dataset with ens IDs \\
* Other meseares as TPM or an additional?! \\
* relevant delta TMP might be problmeatic - some genes might be more sensitive to smaller changes \\
* Pagerank might be too focused on first level Proteins \\
    % TODO check how pagerank is implemented
