The discussion section that follows delves into the practical implications of our research,
where we examine how the insights gained from analyzing the top 10 genes can be translated into actionable recommendations
for future studies or clinical applications.
We also acknowledge the limitations of our approach and
highlight potential avenues for improving the accuracy and reliability of predictive models in lung cancer diagnosis.
