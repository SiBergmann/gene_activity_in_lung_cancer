\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
The discussion section that follows investigates the practical implications of our research,
where we examine how the insights gained from analyzing the top 10 genes can be translated into actionable recommendations
for future studies or clinical applications.
We also acknowledge the limitations of our approach and
highlight potential avenues for improving the accuracy and reliability of predictive models in lung cancer diagnostics.

In conclusion of this chapter, our study has successfully identified 10 genes that could be biomarkers for lung cancer.
By analyzing their relationships and relevance in oncology,
we found that some of these genes have already been recognized as potential biomarkers, while others remain uncharacterized.
Interestingly, when examining well-known biomarkers within the network,
we observed that they tend to be less connected and exhibit lower changes in gene expression compared to our top-ranked genes.
In general our approach is limited by the quality of the data and the underlying assumptions
but it provides a promising starting point for further research.
