\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}
Next, we will delve into the details of the experimental setup.
We will discuss the data sources and their transformation, the creation of the graph database,
and the application of algorithms on the graph database.
The source code and result of this research is publicly available and can be found here:\\

\input{capitle/03_03_graph_database}

\input{capitle/03_04_page_rank}


In conclusion, by successfully completing our \ref{obj:delta_tpm}. and \ref{obj:graph_algorithm}. objective,
we have created the base data, established a graph database and performed the PageRank algorithm on our network.
This will allow us to identify key genes within the network that exhibit both high connectivity
and significant changes in gene activity.
