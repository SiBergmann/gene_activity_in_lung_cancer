\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}

Here, we will delve into the details of the experimental setup.
We will discuss the data sources and their transformation, the creation of the graph database,
and the application of algorithms on the graph database.

% TODO Conclusion
% First objective fulfilled
% Secoden Objective Fulfilled
In conclusion, by successfully completing our second objective~\cref{obj:graph_algorithm},
we have established a graph database and performed the PageRank algorithm on our network.
This has allowed us to identify key genes within the network that exhibit both high connectivity
and significant changes in gene activity.
