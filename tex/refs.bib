But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

    abstract = {Graph representations provide an elegant solution to capture and analyze complex molecular mechanisms in the cell. Co-expression networks are undirected graph representations of transcriptional co-behavior indicating (co-)regulations, functional modules or even physical interactions between the corresponding gene products. The growing avalanche of available RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data fuels the construction of such networks, which are usually stored in relational databases like most other biological data. Inferring linkage by recursive multiple-join statements, however, is computationally expensive and complex to design in relational databases. In contrast, graph databases store and represent complex interconnected data as nodes, edges and properties, making it fast and intuitive to query and analyze relationships. While graph-based database technologies are on their way from a fringe domain to going mainstream, there are only a few studies reporting their application to biological data. We used the graph database management system Neo4j to store and analyze co-expression networks derived from RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Comparing co-expression in tumors versus healthy tissues in six cancer types revealed significant perturbation tracing back to erroneous or rewired gene regulation. Applying centrality, community detection and pathfinding graph algorithms uncovered the destruction or creation of central nodes, modules and relationships in co-expression networks of tumors. Given the speed, accuracy and straightforwardness of managing these densely connected networks, we conclude that graph databases are ready for entering the arena of biological data.},

    abstract = {Finding disease genes related to cancer is of great importance for diagnosis and treatment. With the development of high-throughput technologies, more and more multiple-level omics data have become available. Thus, it is urgent to develop computational methods to identify cancer genes by integrating these data. We propose an integrative rank-based method called iRank to prioritize cancer genes by integrating multi-omics data in a unified network-based framework. The method was used to identify the disease genes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans using the multi-omics data for HCC from TCGA after building up integrated networks in the corresponding molecular levels. The kernel of iRank is based on an improved PageRank algorithm with constraints. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the method, we performed experiments for comparison between single-level omics data and multiple omics data as well as with other algorithms: random walk (RW), random walk with restart on heterogeneous network (RWH), PRINCE and PhenoRank. We also performed a case study on another cancer, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). The results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of iRank which demonstrates the significance of integrating multi-omics data and multiplex networks in cancer gene prioritization.}

    abstract = {Studies performed to discover genes overexpressed in inflammatory diseases identified dermokine as being upregulated in such disease conditions. Dermokine is a gene that was first observed as expressed in the differentiated layers of skin. Its two major isoforms, α and β, are transcribed from different promoters of the same locus, with the α isoform representing the C terminus of the β isoform. Recently, additional transcript variants have been identified. Extensive in silico analysis and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR cloning has confirmed the existence of these variants in human cells and tissues, identified a new human isoform as well as the γ isoform in mouse. Recombinant expression and analysis of the C-terminal truncated isoform indicate that the molecule is O-linked glycosylated and forms multimers in solution. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry has shown that the gene is differentially expressed in various cells and tissues, other than the skin. These results show that the dermokine gene is expressed in epithelial tissues other than the skin and this expression is transciptionally and posttranscriptionally complex.},

The latter may result in serious complications, or in severe cases, sudden death. Currently, there are very few effective treatment options available for EDMD and so there is a high clinical need for new therapies. Various genetic mutations have been identified in the development and causation of EDMD, each encoding proteins that are components of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which spans the nuclear envelope and serves to connect the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton. Within this review, we examine how mutations in the genes encoding these proteins, including lamins A/C, emerin, nesprins 1/2, FHL1, and SUN1/2 lead to muscle cell differentiation and development pathway defects. Further work to identify conserved molecular pathways downstream of these defective proteins may reveal potential targets for therapy design.},

An exon 2 insertion, carboxy-terminal histidine tag and preferred bacterial codons differentiate the MBP21.5 gene from that encoding the adult, brain-derived form of human MBP (18.5 kDa isoform; hMBP18.5). MBPs were expressed at high levels in E. coli and extracted from whole cells by simultaneous acid solubilization and mechanical disruption. A nearly two-fold increase in recombinant protein was detected in strains harboring MBP genes with bacterial preferred codons compared to genes containing human codons. The recombinant molecules were purified in two steps, first by reversed-phase chromatographic separation and then by metal affinity chromatography. Dimeric forms of recombinant MBP21.5 were detected under physiological conditions, however, substitution of a serine for the single cysteine at amino acid residue 81 resulted in only monomer formation. All forms of recombinant MBPs induced proliferative responses of human T lymphocytes specific for epitopes in MBP18.5 kDa. In contrast, human T cell lines that recognize an exon 2-encoded epitope of MBP responded to the 21.5 kDa isoform of MBP, but not the 18.5 kDa isoform.},

The present review describes the current state of knowledge concerning elastin as an elastic macromolecule. First, the genetic, biological, biochemical and biophysical processes leading to a functional polymer are described. Second, the elastic function of elastin is discussed. The controversy on elastin structure and elasticity is discussed and a novel dynamic mechanism of elasticity proposed. Finally, pathologies where the elastin molecule is involved are considered. This updated description of functional elastin provides the required background for the understanding of its pathologies and defines clearly the properties a substance should possess to be qualified as a good elastic biomaterial.},
