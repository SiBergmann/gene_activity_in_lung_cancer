Omics technologies provide powerful tools for studying various molecules, such as genes, proteins, and metabolites, in a particular state and at a particular time. Although omics has had a presence in the radiation community for more than 3 decades, the use of it is still in its infancy. Omics studies enable radiation researchers to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the biological effects of radiation exposure on normal and cancerous tissues, and to answer critical questions such as individual sensitivity, risk assessment, and biomarker discovery. In this commentary, we take a look back at the omics studies that have been conducted in radiation research in the last 20 years and discuss whether omics has fulfilled expectations by examining the knowledge and research gaps in radiation omics.},

    abstract="Real world data offers a lot of possibilities to be represented as graphs. As a result we obtain undirected or directed graphs, multigraphs and hypergraphs, labelled or weighted graphs and their variants. A development of graph modelling brings also new approaches, e.g., considering constraints. Processing graphs in a database way can be done in many different ways. Some graphs can be represented as JSON or XML structures and processed by their native database tools. More generally, a graph database is specified as any storage system that provides index-free adjacency, i.e. an explicit graph structure. Graph database technology contains some technological features inherent to traditional databases, e.g. ACID properties and availability. Use cases of graph databases like Neo4j, OrientDB, InfiniteGraph, FlockDB, AllegroGraph, and others, document that graph databases are becoming a common means for any connected data. In Big Data era, important questions are connected with scalability for large graphs as well as scaling for read/write operations. For example, scaling graph data by distributing it in a network is much more difficult than scaling simpler data models and is still a work in progress. Still a challenge is pattern matching in graphs providing, in principle, an arbitrarily complex identity function. Mining complete frequent patterns from graph databases is also challenging since supporting operations are computationally costly. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and limitations in these areas as well as future directions.",

    ABSTRACT = {Biomarkers are vital in healthcare as they provide valuable insights into disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment response, and personalized medicine. They serve as objective indicators, enabling early detection and intervention, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced costs. Biomarkers also guide treatment decisions by predicting disease outcomes and facilitating individualized treatment plans. They play a role in monitoring disease progression, adjusting treatments, and detecting early signs of recurrence. Furthermore, biomarkers enhance drug development and clinical trials by identifying suitable patients and accelerating the approval process. In this review paper, we described a variety of biomarkers applicable for cancer detection and diagnosis, such as imaging-based diagnosis (CT, SPECT, MRI, and PET), blood-based biomarkers (proteins, genes, mRNA, and peptides), cell imaging-based diagnosis (needle biopsy and CTC), tissue imaging-based diagnosis (IHC), and genetic-based biomarkers (RNAseq, scRNAseq, and spatial transcriptomics).},

    abstract = {Graph representations provide an elegant solution to capture and analyze complex molecular mechanisms in the cell. Co-expression networks are undirected graph representations of transcriptional co-behavior indicating (co-)regulations, functional modules or even physical interactions between the corresponding gene products. The growing avalanche of available RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data fuels the construction of such networks, which are usually stored in relational databases like most other biological data. Inferring linkage by recursive multiple-join statements, however, is computationally expensive and complex to design in relational databases. In contrast, graph databases store and represent complex interconnected data as nodes, edges and properties, making it fast and intuitive to query and analyze relationships. While graph-based database technologies are on their way from a fringe domain to going mainstream, there are only a few studies reporting their application to biological data. We used the graph database management system Neo4j to store and analyze co-expression networks derived from RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Comparing co-expression in tumors versus healthy tissues in six cancer types revealed significant perturbation tracing back to erroneous or rewired gene regulation. Applying centrality, community detection and pathfinding graph algorithms uncovered the destruction or creation of central nodes, modules and relationships in co-expression networks of tumors. Given the speed, accuracy and straightforwardness of managing these densely connected networks, we conclude that graph databases are ready for entering the arena of biological data.},

With the development of high-throughput technologies, more and more multiple-level omics data have become available. Thus, it is urgent to develop computational methods to identify cancer genes by integrating these data. We propose an integrative rank-based method called iRank to prioritize cancer genes by integrating multi-omics data in a unified network-based framework. The method was used to identify the disease genes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans using the multi-omics data for HCC from TCGA after building up integrated networks in the corresponding molecular levels. The kernel of iRank is based on an improved PageRank algorithm with constraints. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the method, we performed experiments for comparison between single-level omics data and multiple omics data as well as with other algorithms: random walk (RW), random walk with restart on heterogeneous network (RWH), PRINCE and PhenoRank. We also performed a case study on another cancer, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). The results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of iRank which demonstrates the significance of integrating multi-omics data and multiplex networks in cancer gene prioritization.}

Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the biological role and mechanism of NDRG2 in SCLC. Initial investigation using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset revealed marked downregulation of NDRG2 transcripts in SCLC. The decreased abundance of NDRG2 in SCLC was verified by examining clinical specimens. Increasing NDRG2 expression in SCLC cell lines caused significant changes in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, colony formation, and chemosensitivity. NDRG2 overexpression decreased the levels of phosphorylated PTEN, AKT and mTOR. In PTEN-depleted SCLC cells, the upregulation of NDRG2 did not result in any noticeable impact on AKT or mTOR activation. Additionally, the reactivation of AKT reversed the antitumour effects of NDRG2 in SCLC cells. Notably, increasing NDRG2 expression retarded the growth of SCLC cell-derived xenografts in vivo. In conclusion, NDRG2 serves as an inhibitor of SCLC, and its cancer-inhibiting effects are achieved through the suppression of AKT/mTOR via the activation of PTEN. This work suggests that NDRG2 is a potential druggable target for SCLC treatment.},

Recently, additional transcript variants have been identified. Extensive in silico analysis and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR cloning has confirmed the existence of these variants in human cells and tissues, identified a new human isoform as well as the γ isoform in mouse. Recombinant expression and analysis of the C-terminal truncated isoform indicate that the molecule is O-linked glycosylated and forms multimers in solution. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry has shown that the gene is differentially expressed in various cells and tissues, other than the skin.

Previous studies have shown that mutation in the dermokine-β (DMKN-β) gene causes pancreatic and colorectal cancer. The role of the carboxy-terminal domain of DMKN-β and dermokine-α (DMKN-α) genes in cancer tumorigenesis. Herein, the role of DMKN-α in pancreatic cancer (PC) tumorigenesis and the mechanisms underlying this process were investigated. Differentially expressed genes between PC and matched normal cells were identified through RNA-seq analysis, and the corresponding protein expression levels were verified using Western blot analysis. In vivo tumor formation experiment was also performed in nude mice. We found that the DMKN-α gene was overexpressed in cancerous pancreatic cell lines compared to normal pancreatic cell lines. CCK-8, colony formation, RTCA test, wound healing, as well as transwell test showed that the overexpression of DMKN-α enhanced the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of PC cells. In vivo assays confirmed that DMKN-α promotes tumorigenesis. The findings of this study show that DMKN-α is a potential oncogene for pancreatic cancer.},

    abstract = {One partner of a fusion gene found in gastric cancer, CD44-SLC1A2, may contribute to the tumor’s abnormal metabolism. It’s ironic, but cancer cells are notoriously bad at cell division, losing bits and rearranging chunks of the genome in the process. One result of this chaos is the birth of chimeric genes, wherein one gene segment gets erroneously fused to part of another, sometimes forming peculiar hybrid proteins that contribute to the cancer cell phenotype. For example, the fused aberrant BCR-ABL gene drives chronic myelogenous leukemia and has proven to be a vulnerable target for therapy. Gene fusions in solid cancers are not so easy to spot, but have been located in prostate and small cell lung cancers. Now, Tao and her co-workers have documented a fusion gene that forms in a small percentage of gastric tumor cells and may contribute to the development of cancer. The authors analyzed copy number variations of genes in more than 100 primary gastric tumors and 27 established gastric tumor cell lines and pinpointed a common breakpoint in three and one, respectively. The resulting chimeric gene fused most of the coding region of SLC1A2/EAAT2 (which encodes a glutamate transporter) to what is probably the strong transcriptional promoter of its neighboring gene, CD44, likely the result of a chromosome inversion. The fusion gene generated a truncated SLC1A2 protein in the original tumors and in a new group of gastric cancers created by the authors through overexpression of the fusion gene in normal gastric cells. But an abnormal protein that lives in tumor cells can be an innocent bystander. So, the authors asked whether the truncated SLC1A2 contributes to gastric cancer development, and their evidence suggested that the answer is yes. Cells in which shortened SLC1A2 expression was silenced with small interfering RNA were less proficient at dividing and invading soft substrates—hallmarks of cancer cells—and overexpression of the pruned protein enhanced these traits. Consistent with the function of SLC1A2 as a transporter of glutamate, the amino acid—which can act as a growth regulator—existed in higher concentrations in gastric cancer cells and cell lines than in normal cells. And in a final set of incriminating evidence, tumor cells that sported the CD44-SLC1A2 fusion gene had higher amounts of SLC1A2 than did wild-type cells, suggesting that this aberrant protein may trigger a pro-oncogenic phenotype. Most other genes that are fused in cancers encode kinase enzymes or transcriptional regulatory proteins. The implication of an overexpressed metabolism-related gene in some gastric tumors may define a new class of cancer-driving genes, although the protein could also augment other cancer-promoting genetic aberrations. The utility of this fusion gene as a drug target or prognostic tool will require more studies, but this particular mistake made by a dividing cancer cell may act as a GPS that directs researchers down a new therapeutic avenue for gastric cancer. Fusion genes are chimeric genes formed in cancers through genomic aberrations such as translocations, amplifications, and rearrangements. To identify fusion genes in gastric cancer, we analyzed regions of chromosomal imbalance in a cohort of 106 primary gastric cancers and 27 cell lines derived from gastric cancers. Multiple samples exhibited genomic breakpoints in the 5′ region of SLC1A2/EAAT2, a gene encoding a glutamate transporter. Analysis of a breakpoint-positive SNU16 cell line revealed expression of a CD44-SLC1A2 fusion transcript caused by a paracentric chromosomal inversion, which was predicted to produce a truncated but functional SLC1A2 protein. In primary tumors, CD44-SLC1A2 gene fusions were detected in 1 to 2\% of gastric cancers, but not in adjacent matched normal gastric tissues. When we specifically silenced CD44-SLC1A2, cellular proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth were significantly reduced. Conversely, CD44-SLC1A2 overexpression in gastric cells stimulated these pro-oncogenic traits. CD44-SLC1A2 silencing caused significant reductions in intracellular glutamate concentrations and sensitized SNU16 cells to cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in gastric cancer. We conclude that fusion of the SLC1A2 gene coding region to CD44 regulatory elements likely causes SLC1A2 transcriptional dysregulation, because tumors expressing high SLC1A2 levels also tended to be CD44-SLC1A2–positive. CD44-SLC1A2 may represent a class of gene fusions in cancers that establish a pro-oncogenic metabolic milieu favoring tumor growth and survival.},

The recent finding of gene fusions in prostate and lung cancers has motivated the search for pathogenic gene fusions in other malignancies. Here, we developed a “breakpoint analysis” pipeline to discover candidate gene fusions by tell-tale transcript level or genomic DNA copy number transitions occurring within genes. Mining data from 974 diverse cancer samples, we identified 198 candidate fusions involving annotated cancer genes. From these, we validated and further characterized novel gene fusions involving ROS1 tyrosine kinase in angiosarcoma (CEP85L/ROS1), SLC1A2 glutamate transporter in colon cancer (APIP/SLC1A2), RAF1 kinase in pancreatic cancer (ATG7/RAF1) and anaplastic astrocytoma (BCL6/RAF1), EWSR1 in melanoma (EWSR1/CREM), CDK6 kinase in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (FAM133B/CDK6), and CLTC in breast cancer (CLTC/VMP1). Notably, while these fusions involved known cancer genes, all occurred with novel fusion partners and in previously unreported cancer types. Moreover, several constituted druggable targets (including kinases), with therapeutic implications for their respective malignancies. Lastly, breakpoint analysis identified new cell line models for known rearrangements, including EGFRvIII and FIP1L1/PDGFRA. Taken together, we provide a robust approach for gene fusion discovery, and our results highlight a more widespread role of fusion genes in cancer pathogenesis.},

    ABSTRACT = {Background and objective: BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with many cancer types in addition to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. However, their relation to lung cancer remains to be explored. Materials and Methods: Observation studies were systematically reviewed to explore the association of BRCA1 or BRCA2 with lung cancer. PubMed, MEDLINE [EBSCOhost], and relevant articles published up to 7 January 2020 were searched. Odd ratio (OR), standardized morbidity rate (SMR), and cancer-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were pooled together as relative risk (RR) estimates (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66–1.40). Results: Thirteen studies were included for analysis. Results showed that the RR of BRCA2 is 0.76 (95% CI, 0.48–1.19), the overall RR is 0.96 (95% CI, 0.66–1.40), and that of BRCA1 is 0.66 (95% CI, 0.41–1.05), indicating that it was not associated with lung cancer. Conclusion: With the limitation of the retrospective study design and severe heterogeneity, these results inform clinicians and relevant families that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have no increased risk of lung cancer.},

    abstract = {BackgroundAlthough early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered a potentially curable disease following complete resection, patients have a wide spectrum of survival according to stage (IB, II, IIIA). Within each stage, gene expression profiles can identify patients with a higher risk of recurrence. We hypothesized that altered mRNA expression in nine genes could help to predict disease outcome: excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) and Twist1 (which regulate N-cadherin expression), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thioredoxin-1 (TRX1), tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), BRCA1, and the human homolog of yeast budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (BubR1).Methodology and Principal FindingsWe performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) in frozen lung cancer tissue specimens from 126 chemonaive NSCLC patients who had undergone surgical resection and evaluated the association between gene expression levels and survival. For validation, we used paraffin-embedded specimens from 58 other NSCLC patients. A strong inter-gene correlation was observed between expression levels of all genes except NFAT. A Cox proportional hazards model indicated that along with disease stage, BRCA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-6]; P = 0.02). In the independent cohort of 58 patients, BRCA1 mRNA expression also significantly correlated with survival (HR, 2.4 [95%CI, 1.01-5.92]; P = 0.04).ConclusionsOverexpression of BRCA1 mRNA was strongly associated with poor survival in NSCLC patients, and the validation of this finding in an independent data set further strengthened this association. Since BRCA1 mRNA expression has previously been linked to differential sensitivity to cisplatin and antimicrotubule drugs, BRCA1 mRNA expression may provide additional information for customizing adjuvant antimicrotubule-based chemotherapy, especially in stage IB, where the role of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated.},

BRCA1 (Breast cancer 1) was previously identified as a breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, but recently gained a major scientific interest as a prognostic and/or predictive marker for various tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in the world. We aimed to review the role of BRCA1 in NSCLC based on currently available literature. Methods: We performed the literature search in Pubmed database, using key words: BRCA1, non small cell lung cancer, chemotherapy, drug resistance. Articles published in English were selected for review. Results: Research papers are mainly focused on BRCA1 mRNA expression studies in response to DNA damaging chemotherapy. Several articles about genetic and epigenetic changes of BRCA1 in NSCLC were also available. Conclusions: BRCA1 is a multifunctional tumor supressor protein, which plays a key role in essential cellular processes and modulates the cellular response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. With the difference from breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA1 has no role in NSCLC cancerogenesis and mainly discussed as a promising genomic marker for customized chemotherapy in NSCLC patients.",

Various genetic mutations have been identified in the development and causation of EDMD, each encoding proteins that are components of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which spans the nuclear envelope and serves to connect the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton. Within this review, we examine how mutations in the genes encoding these proteins, including lamins A/C, emerin, nesprins 1/2, FHL1, and SUN1/2 lead to muscle cell differentiation and development pathway defects.

    abstract = {The Src tyrosine kinase associates with the focal adhesion adaptor protein Cas (Crk-associated substrate) to suppress the expression of potential tumor suppressor genes. For example, Src utilizes Cas to suppress the expression of the LIM-only protein Fhl1 (four and a half LIM domains 1), in order to promote non-anchored tumor-cell growth and migration. Here, we report that the promoter region of the Fhl1 gene was methylated more in Src-transformed cells than non-transformed cells. In addition, global expression analysis indicates that Fhl1 induced expression of serum deprivation response factor (Sdpr) in Src-transformed cells. Moreover, Fhl1 and Sdpr was expressed in approximately 87\% and 40\% of samples obtained from non-transformed breast, 100\% of samples obtained from non-transformed kidney, and over 60\% of samples obtained from non-transformed prostate. In contrast, Fhl1 and Sdpr was detected in approximately 40\% and 7\% of matched samples from mammary carcinoma, less than 11\% of matched samples from kidney carcinoma, and in less than 22\% of matched samples from prostate carcinoma. These data indicate that Fhl1 and Sdpr expression was significantly reduced in tumors of the breast (P < 0.02 and P < 0.001), kidney (P < 0.01), and prostate (P < 0.05). In addition, although Src can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to promote tumor-cell growth, our data indicate that Src did not rely on MAPK activity to suppress the expression of Fhl1 and Sdpr in transformed cells. Thus, Src induced methylation of the promoter region of the Fhl1 gene; Src suppressed Fhl1 and Sdpr expression independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity; Fhl1 induced the expression of Sdpr in Src-transformed cells; and Fhl1 and Sdpr expression was suppressed in tumors of the breast, kidney, and prostate.

The purpose of this study was to examine FHL1 expression in lung cancer patients and to investigate how it was associated with lung cancer cell growth.

FHL1 expression was strongly correlated with tumor histological types (p < 10−4) and the differentiation of the tumor (p = 0.002). FHL1 inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of human lung cancer cell lines. The inhibitory effects of FHL1 on lung cancer cell growth were associated with both the G1 and the G2/M cell cycle arrest concomitant with a marked inhibition of cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cyclin D as well as the induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 (WAF1/CIP1) and p27 (Kip1). Direct intratumoral injection of an adenovirus expressing FHL1 dramatically suppressed the growth of A549 lung cancer cells in nude mice. Our data suggest that reduced expression of FHL1 may play an important role in the development and progression of lung cancer and that FHL1 may be a useful target for lung cancer gene therapy.},

An exon 2 insertion, carboxy-terminal histidine tag and preferred bacterial codons differentiate the MBP21.5 gene from that encoding the adult, brain-derived form of human MBP (18.5 kDa isoform; hMBP18.5). MBPs were expressed at high levels in E. coli and extracted from whole cells by simultaneous acid solubilization and mechanical disruption. A nearly two-fold increase in recombinant protein was detected in strains harboring MBP genes with bacterial preferred codons compared to genes containing human codons. The recombinant molecules were purified in two steps, first by reversed-phase chromatographic separation and then by metal affinity chromatography. Dimeric forms of recombinant MBP21.5 were detected under physiological conditions, however, substitution of a serine for the single cysteine at amino acid residue 81 resulted in only monomer formation. All forms of recombinant MBPs induced proliferative responses of human T lymphocytes specific for epitopes in MBP18.5 kDa. In contrast, human T cell lines that recognize an exon 2-encoded epitope of MBP responded to the 21.5 kDa isoform of MBP, but not the 18.5 kDa isoform.},

As a consequence, elastin was conventionally described as an amorphous polymer. Recent results in the biomedical, biochemical and biophysical fields have lead to the conclusion that the presence of elastin in the extracellular space has very complex implications involving many other molecules. The present review describes the current state of knowledge concerning elastin as an elastic macromolecule. First, the genetic, biological, biochemical and biophysical processes leading to a functional polymer are described. Second, the elastic function of elastin is discussed. The controversy on elastin structure and elasticity is discussed and a novel dynamic mechanism of elasticity proposed. Finally, pathologies where the elastin molecule is involved are considered. This updated description of functional elastin provides the required background for the understanding of its pathologies and defines clearly the properties a substance should possess to be qualified as a good elastic biomaterial.},

    abstract = {Abstract Elastin (ELN) fibers are essential constituents of the tumor microenvironment of gastric cancer (GC). However, few studies have investigated the clinical prognostic significance of ELN in GC. We screened for molecular markers that were highly related to distant metastasis by transcriptome sequencing. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Harbin Medical University (HMU) validation cohorts were used to validate ELN expression and to explore molecular mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry for ELN, vimentin (VIM), and fibroblast activation protein, and elastic fiber-specific staining were used to evaluate the relationship between ELN and prognosis. R studio was used to construct a nomogram prognostic model. In this study, we found that ELN mRNA levels were significantly higher in cancer tissues and were associated with poor prognosis in TCGA and HMU patients. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that ELN was mainly enriched in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. The mRNA expression of ELN was positively correlated with fibroblast molecular markers, especially VIM. For validation, we collected a tissue microarray containing 180 pairs of samples. We found that ELN was positively correlated with VIM expression in cancer tissue but not in paracancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry staining. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the expression of ELN and lymph node metastasis rate were independent predictors for overall survival. Moreover, a nomogram model was used to evaluate the risk of death by combining the expression of ELN and lymph node metastasis rate. ELN may play an important role in the progression of GC by regulating EMT and is a useful prognostic indicator in predicting the prognosis of GC.},

    abstract = {Multiple, complex molecular events characterize cancer development and progression. Deciphering the molecular networks that distinguish organ-confined disease from metastatic disease may lead to the identification of biomarkers of cancer invasion and disease aggressiveness. Although alterations in gene expression have been extensively quantified during neoplastic progression, complementary analyses of proteomic changes have been limited. Here we interrogate the proteomic alterations in a cohort of 15 prostate-derived tissues that included five each from adjacent benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer, and metastatic disease from distant sites. The experimental strategy couples isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation with multidimensional liquid phase peptide fractionation followed by tandem mass spectrometry. Over 1000 proteins were quantified across the specimens and delineated into clinically localized and metastatic prostate cancer-specific signatures. Included in these class-specific profiles were both proteins that were known to be dysregulated during prostate cancer progression and new ones defined by this study. Enrichment analysis of the prostate cancer-specific proteomic signature, to gain insight into the functional consequences of these alterations, revealed involvement of miR-128-a/b regulation during prostate cancer progression. This finding was validated using real time PCR analysis for microRNA transcript levels in an independent set of 15 clinical specimens. miR-128 levels were elevated in benign prostate epithelial cell lines compared with invasive prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of miR-128 induced invasion in benign prostate epithelial cells, whereas its overexpression attenuated invasion in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our profiles of the proteomic alterations of prostate cancer progression revealed miR-128 as a potentially important negative regulator of prostate cancer cell invasion.},

    abstract = {Purpose: Tumor-initiating cells are resistant to chemotherapy, but how microRNAs play a role in regulating drug resistance of breast tumor–initiating cells (BT-IC) needs to be clarified.Experimental Design: Lentivirus-mediated miR-128 transduction was done in BT-ICs, enriched by mammosphere cultures or CD44+CD24− fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Apoptosis and DNA damage were determined upon treatment with doxorubicin. Expression of miR-128 in breast cancer tissues was examined by in situ hybridization and correlated with breast tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and patient survival.Results: MiR-128 was significantly reduced in chemoresistant BT-ICs enriched from breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors (P \&lt; 0.01), accompanied by an overexpression of Bmi-1 and ABCC5, which were identified as targets of miR-128. Ectopic expression of miR-128 reduced the protein levels of Bmi-1 and ABCC5 in BT-ICs, along with decreased cell viability (P \&lt; 0.001) and increased apoptosis (P \&lt; 0.001) and DNA damage (P \&lt; 0.001) in the presence of doxorubicin. Reduced miR-128 expression in breast tumor tissues was associated with chemotherapeutic resistance (P \&lt; 0.001) and poor survival of breast cancer patients (P \&lt; 0.05; n = 57).Conclusions: Reduction in miR-128 leading to Bmi-1 and ABCC5 overexpression is a stem cell–like feature of BT-ICs, which contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancers. Ectopic expression of miR-128 sensitizes BT-ICs to the proapoptotic and DNA-damaging effects of doxorubicin, indicating therapeutic potential. Clin Cancer Res; 17(22); 7105–15. ©2011 AACR.},
